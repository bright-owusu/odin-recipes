A basic recipe website - ODIN PROJECT

This project involves building a basic recipe website to enhance HTML skills.
It includes an index page with recipe links, focusing on structured content and HTML elements.
The initial version prioritizes functionality over aesthetics, with plans to revisit and style
it using CSS in the future. This project serves as a foundational step towards mastering HTML
and preparing for more advanced web development.
