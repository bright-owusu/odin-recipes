    <!-- Steps for preparing Ghanaian Jollof -->
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add onions and 2 tablespoons of oil to a blender and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and habanero pepper to the blender, and pulse until smooth. Transfer to a separate medium bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the remaining &frac13; cup (80 ml) of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the oil is shimmering, add the onion puree and cook until the water has cooked out and the puree is starting to brown, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the tomato puree and add the curry powder, garlic powder, ginger, dried herbs, and crushed bouillon cubes. Cook for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the stew has reduced by half and is deep red in color.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the rice, mixed vegetables, and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pot with foil and a lid. Simmer for another 30 minutes, until the rice is cooked through and the liquid is absorbed.
